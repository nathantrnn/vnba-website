## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges

#### Risk: Performance Impact of Animations
**Description:** GSAP animations and complex interactions could negatively impact page performance, especially on mobile devices.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement animations using requestAnimationFrame and GPU acceleration
- Use performance budgeting to monitor impact
- Apply progressive enhancement approach: basic experience works without JS
- Lazy-load animation scripts
- Test animations on various devices throughout development

#### Risk: Limited Styling Control with Google Forms
**Description:** Google Forms offers limited styling options that may not align with the premium design aesthetic.

**Mitigation:**
- Create custom UI overlays where possible
- Use CSS to style elements that can be targeted
- Design form embedding with complementary visual elements
- Set clear client expectations about Google Forms limitations
- Consider alternative form solutions if styling becomes critical issue

#### Risk: Complex Responsive Behavior
**Description:** Premium design elements may be difficult to adapt across all device sizes while maintaining visual integrity.

**Mitigation:**
- Adopt mobile-first design approach
- Create distinct design solutions for critical breakpoints
- Thoroughly document responsive behavior expectations
- Implement thorough testing on multiple devices
- Prioritize functionality over exact visual matching on extreme sizes

### MVP Scope Management

#### Risk: Feature Creep Beyond Budget
**Description:** Client requests for additional features could expand scope beyond the $10,000 budget.

**Mitigation:**
- Clearly document MVP requirements in this PRD
- Implement change request process with impact assessment
- Maintain prioritized feature backlog for post-MVP phases
- Establish clear criteria for MVP completion
- Regular client reviews to maintain alignment on scope

#### Risk: Content Delays Impacting Timeline
**Description:** Delays in receiving final content could impact development timeline.

**Mitigation:**
- Develop with placeholder content that matches final dimensions
- Create content templates and guidelines early
- Establish clear content delivery milestones and dependencies
- Implement content in phases with most critical elements first
- Build flexibility into the timeline for content revisions

#### Risk: Browser Compatibility Challenges
**Description:** Premium animations and effects may not work consistently across all browser environments.

**Mitigation:**
- Define browser support matrix early in development
- Implement graceful degradation for older browsers
- Use feature detection rather than browser detection
- Thorough cross-browser testing throughout development
- Documented fallback behaviors for unsupported features

### Resource Constraints

#### Risk: Animation Complexity Requiring Specialized Expertise
**Description:** Complex GSAP animations may require specialized expertise beyond initial resource allocation.

**Mitigation:**
- Assess animation requirements early and identify skill gaps
- Create animation prototypes to validate feasibility
- Prioritize animations by importance and complexity
- Consider simplified alternatives for highly complex animations
- Allocate budget specifically for animation specialists if needed

#### Risk: Performance Optimization Time Requirements
**Description:** Achieving target performance metrics (≥90 Lighthouse score) may require significant optimization time.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement performance best practices from project start
- Regular performance testing throughout development
- Identify and address performance issues early
- Establish performance budget for each page
- Document optimization strategies for consistent implementation

#### Risk: Integration Limitations
**Description:** Third-party integrations (Google Forms, Calendar) may have limitations that affect functionality.

**Mitigation:**
- Research integration capabilities early in development
- Build proof-of-concepts for critical integrations
- Document limitations and workarounds
- Develop fallback solutions for critical functionality
- Set clear client expectations about integration boundaries
